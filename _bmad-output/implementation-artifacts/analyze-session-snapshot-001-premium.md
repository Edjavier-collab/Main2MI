### Empathy Score Section
**Empathy Score**

[Circular gauge showing 4/5 - 80% filled]

You showed genuine empathy throughout the session. When the patient said 'I know I should quit, but I'm scared of failing again,' you responded with 'It sounds like you've tried before and that experience left you feeling uncertain.' This reflection demonstrated that you were truly listening to both sides of their ambivalence. Your follow-up question 'What would make this attempt different from previous ones?' showed curiosity about their perspective rather than pushing an agenda.

### What Went Right Section
**What Went Right** [Thumbs up icon]

You demonstrated excellent reflective listening skills. When the patient expressed fear about failing again, you reflected: 'It sounds like you've tried before and that experience left you feeling uncertain.' This showed you were truly hearing their concerns. You also used open-ended questions effectively, such as 'What would make this attempt different from previous ones?' which invited the patient to explore their own motivations rather than being told what to do.

### Key Areas for Growth Section
**Key Areas for Growth** [Seedling icon]

A key area for growth is deepening your reflections to capture underlying emotions. For instance, when the patient said 'I want to change but I don't know if I can handle it,' you responded with 'You want to change.' A missed opportunity was to reflect the emotion behind their statement. You could have tried: 'You want to change, and at the same time you're feeling overwhelmed by the thought of what that would require.' This would have validated both their desire and their fear, which is central to MI.
