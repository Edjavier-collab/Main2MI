### What Went Right Section
**What Went Right** [Thumbs up icon]

You demonstrated excellent reflective listening skills. When the patient expressed fear about failing again, you reflected: 'It sounds like you've tried before and that experience left you feeling uncertain.' This showed you were truly hearing their concerns. You also used open-ended questions effectively, such as 'What would make this attempt different from previous ones?' which invited the patient to explore their own motivations rather than being told what to do.
