  "keyTakeaway": "You effectively used summaries to consolidate understanding and check for accuracy, demonstrating advanced MI skills.",

  "empathyBreakdown": "You demonstrated exceptional empathy and advanced MI skills throughout this session. Your use of summaries was particularly effective. When you said 'Let me make sure I understand - you value your health and your ability to be present for your family, and you're noticing that your current behavior is getting in the way of those values. At the same time, this behavior has been a way of managing stress, and you're worried about what you'll do without it. Is that accurate?' This summary captured multiple themes, checked for accuracy, and validated both sides of the patient's ambivalence. Your reflections were consistently sophisticated, and your questions invited deep exploration of values and motivations.",

Your summary 'Let me make sure I understand - you value your health and your ability to be present for your family, and you're noticing that your current behavior is getting in the way of those values.

Your reflections were sophisticated, consistently capturing both content and emotion. Your questions invited deep exploration, such as 'What would need to happen for you to feel confident about making a change?'",
  "constructiveFeedback": "This was an exemplary MI session demonstrating advanced skills. One area for continued refinement is to occasionally use developing discrepancy more explicitly - highlighting the gap between the patient's values and their current behavior in a way that invites them to explore it further. For instance, after identifying values, you could have tried: 'I'm hearing that you value your health and being present for your family, and you've also mentioned that your current behavior is affecting both of those. What's that like for you, noticing that gap?'",
  "areasForGrowth": "Continue refining your ability to develop discrepancy in a way that invites exploration rather than creates defensiveness. Practice highlighting the gap between values and behavior in a collaborative, curious way.",
