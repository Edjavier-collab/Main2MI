### Strengths and Trends Section
**Strengths and Trends**

Across your 8 sessions, you've demonstrated exceptional growth and mastery of MI skills. Your empathy scores have shown a remarkable upward trend, improving from an average of 3.0 in your first three sessions to 4.5 in your most recent three sessions. This progression demonstrates your commitment to developing your MI practice.

* **Advanced Reflection Skills**: You've developed sophisticated reflection skills, consistently using complex reflections that capture ambivalence, emotion, and multiple themes. Your reflection count has increased from an average of 3.0 per session in early sessions to 7.0 in recent sessions.

* **Eliciting Change Talk**: You've become highly skilled at eliciting change talk, with usage increasing from 1.0 per session early on to 4.0 per session recently. Your questions have evolved to be more evocative, exploring values and motivations effectively.

* **Summarizing**: You've developed strong summarizing skills, consistently using summaries to consolidate understanding and check for accuracy. Your summaries have become more comprehensive, weaving together multiple themes.

* **Skill Integration**: You're effectively integrating multiple MI skills within single sessions, creating a cohesive, patient-centered approach.

### Areas for Focus Section
**Areas for Focus**

While your overall performance is exceptional, one area for continued refinement emerged across your 8 sessions:

* **Developing Discrepancy**: Although you've used developing discrepancy more frequently in recent sessions (increasing from 0 to 2 instances per session), there's still room to use this skill more consistently. When used effectively, developing discrepancy helps patients explore the gap between their values and their current behavior, which can be a powerful motivator for change.

This pattern emerged from analyzing all 8 sessions. While you're using this skill more than before, incorporating it more consistently will further strengthen your MI practice.

### Summary and Next Steps Section
**Summary and Next Steps**

Outstanding work across 8 sessions! Your growth trajectory is impressive - from solid foundational skills to advanced MI practice. Your empathy scores are consistently high, and you're effectively integrating multiple MI skills.

**For your next practice session**, continue refining your ability to develop discrepancy. Practice highlighting the gap between the patient's values and their current behavior in a collaborative, curious way that invites exploration rather than creates defensiveness. For example, after identifying values, you might try: 'I'm hearing that you value your health and being present for your family, and you've also mentioned that your current behavior is affecting both of those. What's that like for you, noticing that gap?'

### Specific Next Steps (Action Items)
**Your Action Plan**

1. Use developing discrepancy at least twice in your next session by highlighting the gap between the patient's values and their current behavior
2. Practice rolling with resistance more proactively - when you sense defensiveness, reflect the patient's concerns before they escalate
3. Continue refining your summarizing skills by creating summaries that weave together values, ambivalence, and change talk
