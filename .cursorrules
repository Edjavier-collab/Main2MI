# MI Practice Coach - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
MI Practice Coach is a web app that helps healthcare professionals practice Motivational Interviewing skills through AI-powered feedback and coaching.

## Tech Stack

- Payments: Stripe ($9.99/mo, $99.99/yr)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables
- PWA enabled

## Theme: Growth Garden
- Primary: Sage green (#87A878)
- All colors MUST use CSS variables from the theme
- Plant/growth metaphors throughout UI
- Professional, clean aesthetic

## Development Rules

### Code Style
- Functional components with hooks only
- TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types
- Use existing patterns found in codebase
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Change Management
- ONE file at a time
- Show changes before applying
- Wait for approval before proceeding to next file
- Commit after each working change

### No Hardcoded Values
- Colors: Use CSS variables (--color-primary, etc.)
- Strings: Use constants or i18n keys
- Magic numbers: Extract to named constants

## Agent System

### Available Agents
